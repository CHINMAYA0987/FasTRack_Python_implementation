# FasTRack_Python_implementation

A recreated Python implementation of the FasTrack framework for safe, real-time motion planning and control (part of ECS618 project).

This project includes a recreation of the 5D–3D vehicle model example from the original FasTrack paper, with all constraints and dynamics faithfully implemented.

- Planning: Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) for global path planning

- Control: Carrot-Chase tracking controller for real-time trajectory tracking

- Reachability: HJ precomputation for computing tracking error bounds; Offline reachability computation module; Seamless integration of planner + tracker + safety constraints

- Simulation: 2D environment with circular obstacles; Start–goal navigation; Real-time visualization
